# Overview

Welcome to my userspace.

A lot of the code for my wrappers/keymaps came from other users, see the [Resources](#resources) section.

## Features

- Home-row mod.
- Tap dance as a safe guard when do dangerous keycode like switch base layer, boot.
- Uses `update_tri_layer_state` for better layer accessibility.
- Combos to access modifier keys.
- Move mouse with kinetic speed.

### Combos

With `combos.def` I can't find a way to use `combo_should_trigger` and `combo_ref_layer`, doesn't seem to work at all.

- Symbol combos.

These are the resources that inspired me to create these features, there might be too many to list all of them.
